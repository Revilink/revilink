**Logs**

We would like to inform you that every time you use our Service, we collect data and information from your phone (through third-party products) called Log Data in case there is an error in the application. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when you use our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files containing small amounts of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. They are sent to your browser from websites you visit and stored in your device's internal memory.

This Service does not explicitly use these "cookies". However, the app may use libraries that use third-party code and "cookies" to collect information and improve its services. You have the option to accept or decline these cookies and you will know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to decline our cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of this Service.

**Service Providers**

We may employ third party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

* To facilitate our Service;
* To provide the Service on our behalf
* To perform service-related services; or
* To help us analyze how our Service is used.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to fulfill the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obliged not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

**Security**

We value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, so we strive to use commercially acceptable methods of protection. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you know that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of those websites. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.
