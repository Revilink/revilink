You should be aware that there are some things for which Revilink will not take responsibility. Certain functions of the app require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection may be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but if you do not have Wi-Fi or Ethernet access and do not have any data, Revilink cannot take responsibility for the app not working in full functionality.

You should note that if you use the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi or Ethernet, the terms of your contract with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data or other third party charges for the duration of the connection when accessing the app. When using the App, if you use the App outside your home country (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming, you accept responsibility for such charges, including roaming data charges. Please note that if you are not the bill payer of the device on which you are using the app, we assume that you have permission from the bill payer to use the app.

Likewise, Revilink cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app, so you need to make sure your device stays charged - Revilink cannot accept responsibility if the battery dies and you cannot turn on the Service.

In relation to Revilink's responsibility for your use of the app, it is important to note that when you use the app, it is important to remember that although we always try to ensure that it is up to date and accurate, we rely on third parties to provide this information to us so that we can make it available to you. Revilink accepts no liability for any direct or indirect loss suffered by you as a result of your sole reliance on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may want to update the app. Revilink does not promise that it will always update the app to be relevant to you and/or to work with the Revilink website you access on your device and the version of Android and iOS you have installed on your device or with your different operating system. However, you promise to always accept updates to the app when offered to you, and we may wish to stop providing the app and may terminate the app at any time without giving you any notice of termination. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will terminate; (b) you must stop using the app and (if necessary) discontinue or delete access to it from your device.
